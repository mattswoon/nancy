It's onlyconnect(ish) but on discord

# How it works

There are two types of games - guess the link or guess the 5th element of the sequence.

Everyone on the channel can add games by DM'ing the bot with the `!link` or
`!seq` followed by the requisite number of clues and an answer on each new line.

Eg
```
!link
water
earth
fire
air
only the avatar can master them all
```

```
!seq
Kuruk
Kyoshi
Roku
Aang
Korra
The last 5 avatars in chronological order
```

Play a game in the main channel by running `!play`. There are no points, so you're just playing for your own ego. If you want to make a guess at the answer, be a kind citizen and use the spoiler alert tag, e.g. `|| my guess here will be hidden and you have to click it to see ||`.

You can get the next clue with `!next-clue`, or reveal the answer with `!reveal`.

If you want to know the number of games that can be played, use `!status`.
